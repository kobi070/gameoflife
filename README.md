### Introduction to Life

Game of Life (or just “Life”) is not really a game. There’s no winning or losing or destroying your opponent mentally and spiritually. Life is a “cellular automaton” - a system of cells that live on a grid, where they live, die and evolve according to the rules that govern their world.

Life’s simple, elegant rules give rise to astonishingly complex emergent behavior. It is played on a 2-D grid. Each square in the grid contains a cell, and each cell starts the game as either “alive” or “dead”. Play proceeds in rounds. During each round, each cell looks at its 8 immediate neighbors and counts up the number of them that are currently alive.
